# Hydrogen and galaxies (10 points)

This problem aims to study the peculiar physics of galaxies, such as their dynamics and structure. In particular,we explain how to measure the mass distribution of our galaxy from the inside. For this we will focus on hydrogen, its main constituent.

Throughout this problem we will only use $\hbar$, defined as $\hbar=h/2\pi$

## Part A - Introduction.

### Bohr model

We assume that the hydrogen atom consists of a non-relativistic electron,with mass $m_{e}$ orbiting a fixed proton. Throughout this part,we assume its motion is on a circular orbit

A.1 Determine the electron's velocity $v$ in a circular orbit of radius $r$. 

In the Bohr model, we assume the magnitude of the electron's angular momentum $L$ is quantized, $L = n\hbar$, where $n > 0$ is an integer. We define $\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar c} \approx 7.27\times 10^{-3}$.

A.2 Show that the radius of the orbit is given by $r_n=n^2r_1$, where $r_1$ is called the Bohr radius. Express $r_1$ in terms of $\alpha$, $m_e$, $c$, and $h$ and calculate its numerical value with 3 digits. Express $v_1$, the velocity on the orbit of radius $r_1$, in terms of $\alpha$ and $c$.

A.3 Determine the electron's mechanical energy $E_n$ on an orbit of radius $r_n$ in terms of $e$, $ε_0$, $r_1$, $n$. Determine $E_1$ in the ground state in terms of $\alpha$, $m_e$, and $c$. Compute its numerical value in eV.

### Hydrogen fine and hyperfine structures

The rare spontaneous inversion of the electron's spin causes a photon to be emitted on average once per 10 million years per hydrogen atom. This emission serves as a hydrogen tracer in the universe and is thus fundamental in astrophysics. We will study the transition responsible for this emission in two steps.

First,consider the interaction between the electron spin and the relative motion of the electron and the proton. Working in the electron's frame of reference,the proton orbits the electron at a distance $r_1$ . This produces a magnetic field $\vec{B}_{1}$

A.4 Determine the magnitude $B_{1}$ of $\vec{B}_{1}$ at the position of the electronin terms of $\mu_0$, e,α,c and $r_1$

Second,the electron spin creates a magnetic moment ${\vec{\mathcal{M}}}_{s}$ . Its magnitude is roughly ${\mathcal{M}}_{s}=\frac{e}{m_{e}}\hbar.$ The fine (F) structure is related to the energy difference $\Delta E_{\mathrm{HF}}$ between an electron with a magnetic moment $\vec{\mathcal{U}}_{s}$ parallel to $\vec{B}_{1}$ and that of an electron with $\vec{\mathcal{M}}_{s}$ anti-parallel to $\overrightarrow{B}_{1}$ .Similarly, the hyperfine (HF) structure is related to the energy difference $\Delta E_{\mathrm{HF}}$ due to the interaction between parallel and anti-parallel magnetic moments of the electron and the proton. It is known to be approximately $\Delta E_{\mathrm{HF}}\simeq3.72\frac{m_{e}}{m_{p}}\Delta E_{\mathrm{F}}$ where $m_{p}$ is the proton mass.

A.5 Express $\Delta E_{\mathrm{F}}$ as a function of $\alpha$ and $E_{1}$. Express the wavelength $\lambda_\mathrm{HF}$ of a photon emitted during a transition between the two states of the hyperfine structure and give its numerical value with two digits.
